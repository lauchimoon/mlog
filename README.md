# mlog
Log media you've experienced.

This intends to be a "journal" for media you've seen like
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) or [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/),
except there's no people to see what you've read, seen or listened...

## Usage
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lauchimoon/mlog
$ cd mlog/
$ go build .
$ ./mlog [-add/-list/-lstype]
```
Running `mlog` with no flags lists the media you've logged.
